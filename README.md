Cats & Dogs Image Classifier
This repository contains code for an image classification project that distinguishes between images of cats and dogs using deep learning. The solution leverages the power of Transfer Learning with a pre-trained ResNet-18 model in PyTorch, allowing for high accuracy with efficient training.

🚀 Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to build an automated system that can accurately classify unseen images into one of two categories: "Cat" or "Dog". We focus on practical implementation, utilizing a robust deep learning architecture and a widely adopted training strategy.

✨ Features
Deep Learning Classification: Uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image recognition.
Transfer Learning: Employs a pre-trained ResNet-18 model (trained on ImageNet) to accelerate learning and improve performance, especially with limited dataset size.
Custom Dataset Handling: Includes a PyTorch Dataset class to efficiently load and preprocess image data.
Training & Prediction: Provides functions for training the model and making predictions on individual images.
Visual Prediction: Displays the input image along with its predicted label.
🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
PyTorch (for deep learning framework)
torchvision (for ResNet-18 model and image transforms)
Pillow (PIL) (for image handling)
Matplotlib (for image visualization)
📂 Dataset Structure
The project expects the images to be organized in a specific hierarchical structure:

Cats-and-Dogs/
├── test_set/
│   └── test_set/
│       ├── cats/
│       └── dogs/
└── training_set/
    └── training_set/
        ├── cats/
        └── dogs/
Images are categorized into cats and dogs subdirectories within their respective training_set and test_set folders.
